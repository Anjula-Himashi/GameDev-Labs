 MeshBasicMaterial
 Does NOT react to light â€” it displays the color or texture as-is.

 Used for flat, unlit materials like simple colors, textures, or wireframes.

 Fast to render because no lighting calculations.

 Good for backgrounds, UI elements, or objects that should always look flat.




 MeshPhongMaterial
 Reacts to lights in the scene (supports diffuse and specular reflections).

 Uses Phong shading model, so it can show shiny surfaces, highlights, and shadows.

 Supports reflections, shininess, and specular highlights.

 Good for realistic materials like metals, plastics, or shiny surfaces.
